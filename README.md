# Welcome to the Stitch Wiki!

Stitch is a simple and VERY slowly growing "game engine" made by stitching together random code and hack solutions. :)

This is my first time doing something like this and feedback is very welcome. :3

If you want to use Stitch to do something with it, feel free to do so!!
