# Welcome to the Stitch Wiki!

Stitch is a simple and VERY slowly growing "game engine" made by stitching together random code and hack solutions. :)

This is my first time doing something like this and feedback is very welcome. :3

If you want to use Stitch to do something with it, feel free to do so!!

# Get Started

1. Add this repository to your project folder.
   This repository uses submodules to compile dependencies like glew or glfw from source.
   You need to clone it recursively. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/SunaaRisu/Stitch`
   If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to clone the necessary submodules.
